      <p data-search="Lab culture and expectations Our lab is in the very fortunate position of sharing space with excellent experimental and computation research groups  We work closely with other groups in Melbourne Integrative Genomics and in the Centre for Stem Cell Systems  and both of these sets of people are great researchers you should always feel free to talk to  We also collaborate with some research groups in the School of BioSciences  with whom we have many research interests in common Above all  my job is to support your time in the lab and ensure that it is as successful as it can be  I want you to do well  and I will try my hardest to make sure you have the resources you need  be that collaborators  reagents or training opportunities  In my lab you will be trained to become a creative  rigorous and independent scientist  In return  you should be willing to work hard  think on your own  challenge yourself and engage with other members of the lab and of MIG in constructive  productive and perhaps unexpected ways  Although you will have your own project  the lab is a collaborative environment where people learn from one another and help each other  and we all work together to ensure that atmosphere is maintained Meetings and mentoring We use Slack for informal and quick communication within the lab   I will invite you to our lab s slack when you join us in Melbourne  In an emergency  however  you should text or call me  My phone number is on every fridge and freezer in our wet lab  and on our shared slack  For bigger emergencies  you should call 000 first  and once you re safe  me We have a joint group meeting with the Shim lab every two or three weeks where someone from either group presents their ongoing research  lab members working on iPSCs are also highly encouraged to attend the biweekly Wells lab CSCS meeting  Beyond that  you will have one on one meetings with me once a week  In these meetings we ll discuss your work  how it is going  what you might want to do next  etc  We also have a brief weekly wet lab meeting with members of the Wells lab where we discuss general issues with cell culture to make sure everyone is on the same page and aware of small issues   eg weird Matrigel batches or rumours of mycoplasma down the hall  All of these are detailed in our shared lab google calendar If you need me to do something for you  tell me about it  but also  tell the slack BusyBot to tell me about it  Just type  busybot  whatever   igr  deadline  in our private slack channel  Please include a deadline  if there is one   otherwise I will assume it s due sometime soon but perhaps not soon enough for your purposes  Also remember that I am not glued to my phone on weekends  holidays or evenings  and I don t expect you to be either    and I might well take a while to get back to you if I m not in the office More broadly  I want you to succeed at whatever career you ve chosen  That includes the traditional PhD postdoc faculty job path  but it also includes all other paths open to you  whether that be moving into industry research  becoming an investment banker or driving the nerdiest food truck in town  I am happy to support you in all of these  although you will probably want to find additional mentors that have more experience in these realms  To make sure you re on track  we ll also meet every 6 months or so to discuss your long term plans and your progress towards achieving them  So that these meetings are fruitful  I ll ask you to complete Individual Development Plans in advance  which will form the basis of our ongoing conversations on these subjects Reproducibility  notebooks and communication All the work we do in the lab should be of high quality  transparent  and reproducible To help us achieve this  there are a few things we do as routine  and a few others we are experimenting with right now  Chief amongst these is making sure everyone thoroughly documents their research  Good record keeping is fundamental to robust science  I expect you to use github or bitbucket to store and version your code  Your repos should be updated frequently  at least once a day when you re working exclusively on dry lab    preferably with informative commit messages  and your code should be legible   remember that eventually it will all be made public Beyond proper documentation of your code  you should always keep a digital notebook that you can share with me and bring to our lab meetings  Because we do a mix of computational and experimental work  most out of the box approaches don t work well for us  We re currently experimenting with both Benchling and Jekyll   they both have their benefits and drawbacks  You re welcome to use either one of those for now  I will invite you to the relevant Benchling account and or give you a five minute Jekyll intro   although eventually we will probably commit to only one  You can also experiment with the R package workFlowR  or try to convince me about switching to your own favourite tool  If you like to use pen and paper that s fine too   take photos of your pages and upload them to Benchling or your Jekyll notebook  Once you delve deeper into computational analyses  I encourage you to explore the world of RStudio and interactive Shiny apps  but please keep in mind that while they are excellent means of presenting data  they re not the best for guaranteeing reproducibility and your work should not depend on them Your cell culture work should be equally well documented  We work with multiple cell lines  and under the microscope they all look identical  so good record keeping and careful labelling are habits you need to embrace from day one   and I will nag you about this  All raw data   gel photos  rtPCR runs  immunostaining images  etc   should be saved  If you can t show me the raw data  I will not believe the final result We also have some basic lab protocols that are common to all members  and some basic data processing best practices  The former are available on both Dropbox and as hard copies in the tissue culture room  the latter are  not written up anywhere yet   Unless you have really good reasons not to  you should follow these at all times Science moves very fast these days  I encourage you to set up a twitter account and follow people you find interesting  or whose work is relevant to your own  It ll serve as a low key networking opportunity  and it will also expose you to what other people are working on  talking about  and thinking about  It ll help you stay current and catch things that you might otherwise not have spotted Living and working in Melbourne Beyond the wealth of academic opportunities at your feet  Melbourne is also a city very much worth exploring  Anything you want to do  you probably can  so far  in the lab we ve dabbled in rock climbing  ukelele playing  ice skating  Japanese language classes and intramural football to list a few   and part of your time with us should include taking advantage of this  I expect   and encourage   you to have a work life balance  No one wants you to burn out six months into your time in the lab because you ve been working non stop 14 hour days in an effort to impress me with your dedication  Relax  I m already impressed If you re moving to Melbourne from afar one of the first things you ll want to consider is accomodation  You can look at the University s website  gumtree  or  if you want to splurge  realestate com au  You should also feel free to reach out to current lab members for more on the ground advice  The University of Melbourne also has a guide to living in the city  Some of its recommendations are geared towards undergraduate students  but on the whole you should find plenty of relevant information there Harrassment and lab code of conductThe lab does not tolerate harassment  and welcomes all regardless of gender or gender identity  ethnicity  sexuality  age  nationality  religion or disability  and this code of conduct will be enforced  If you have concerns about someone else in the lab  you are always welcome to talk to me  if you feel comfortable doing it  If your concerns are about me  or feel uncomfortable discussing the issue with me  you should reach out to your advisory committee  or  if you don t have one yet  to Devi Stuart Fox  who is deputy chair for graduate education in BioSciences  Ultimately  you may also consider lodging a complaint or a grievance in keeping with University policy Getting help Sometimes you might have personal problems  You are under no obligation to discuss these with me  but if I can help you with them  I will  There are campus resources available to you and you should be neither afraid nor ashamed of making use of them  Staying healthy   physically and mentally   is fundamental if you re going to enjoy your time in academia ">
